When disposition is collected for each Epoch, the variable EPOCH should be included in the DS dataset. When EPOCH is populated for disposition events (records with DSCAT = DISPOSITION EVENT), EPOCH is the name of the Epoch for the disposition event described in the record. This is a subtly different meaning from that of EPOCH when it is used in other general-observation-class domains, where EPOCH, as a Timing variable, is the name of the Epoch during which --STDTC or --DTC falls. The values of EPOCH are drawn from the Trial Arms domain, Section 7.2 - Experimental Design: Trial Arms (TA)",
