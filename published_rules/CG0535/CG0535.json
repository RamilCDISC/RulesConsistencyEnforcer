It describes whether a subject completed study participation or a study treatment, and if not, the reason they did not complete it. Dispositions may be described for each Epoch (e.g., screening, initial treatment, washout, cross-over treatment, follow-up) or for the study as a whole. If disposition events for both study participation and study treatment(s) are to be represented, then DSSCAT provides this distinction. The value of DSSCAT is based on the sponsor's controlled terminology, however for records with DSCAT = \"DISPOSITION EVENT\", DSSCAT = \"STUDY PARTICIPATION\" is used to represent disposition of study participation. DSSCAT = \"STUDY TREATMENT\" can be used as a generic identifier when a study has only a single treatment. If a study has multiple treatments, then DSSCAT should name the individual treatment.",
